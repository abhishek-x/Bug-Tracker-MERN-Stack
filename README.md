# Bug-Tracker-MERN
Fully Responsive Full MERN Stack Application written in modern React on the frontend with Hooks and Context. Designed to allow employees/developers to keep track of the current tasks/bugs they are working on. Backend with Node/Express and MongoDB for the database. Tested with Postman. Used other npm packages and express middleware. Authentication using JSON Web Tokens.

## Installation

You can install this application by running `git clone https://github.com/HarryWilson1995/Bug-Tracker-MERN`

After cloning the repository, make sure to install all dependencies by running the following command (both in the client folder and in the root for the serverside dependencies):

```
npm install
```

Making sure that you are in the root directory, run the following script which will start the server on the backend and the react server and open the app in your browser:

```

## License

## Future Plans 

In the future I plan on building out an admin feature of the site which will allow team leaders to check up on all the tasks their team members are working on. Following on from this I would like to implement a notification system so that anyone working on a bug will receive an email when a task is edited/updated/deleted.
