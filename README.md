Fully Responsive Full MERN Stack Application written in modern React on the frontend with Hooks and Context.

## Future Plans 

In the future I plan on building out an admin feature of the site which will allow team leaders to check up on all the tasks their team members are working on. Following on from this I would like to implement a notification system so that anyone working on a bug will receive an email when a task is edited/updated/deleted.
